# Hire Veronica Eulenberg Quasar App

This app showcases my transformational and full stack skills. What do I mean by the former? I first made the basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript page, and then created the default Quasar app, and transformed my page into a Quasar app. What do I mean by latter? I used Quasar to build the frontend, then used Node to handle form data, and used Heroku's Postgres to store the data.

Go to the Quasar app to see it in action.
